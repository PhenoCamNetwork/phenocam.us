		Vegetation  phenology  controls  the  seasonality  of  many  ecosystem  processes,  as  well  as numerous biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks. Phenology is highly sensitive to climate change and  variability.  Here  we  present  a  dataset,  consisting  of  <b>~750</b> site-years  of observations,  characterizing  vegetation  phenology  in  diverse  ecosystems  across  North America. Our data are derived from conventional, visible-wavelength digital camera imagery collected through the PhenoCam network. For each archived image, we extracted RGB (red, green, blue) colour channel information, with means and other statistics calculated across a region-of-interest  (ROI)  delineating  a  specific  vegetation  type.  From  the  high-frequency (typically,  30  minute)  imagery,  we  derived  time  series characterizing  vegetation  colour, including “canopy greenness”, processed to 1- and 3-day intervals. For ecosystems with a single annual cycle of vegetation activity, we provide date estimates, with uncertainties, for the start, middle, and end of spring green-up and autumn green-down (senescent) phases. The PhenoCam database and R toolbox can be used for phenological model validation and development, evaluation of satellite remote sensing data products, and studies of climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems.
